A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.
If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without 
adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.

 A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is
 one that has been left blank during record creation!
