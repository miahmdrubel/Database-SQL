***The SQL GROUP BY Statement:-
The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
***lists the number of customers in each country:
Example
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;

***lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low:

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
*** lists the number of orders sent by each shipper:
SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
GROUP BY ShipperName;
