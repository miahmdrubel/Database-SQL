*** SQL alias:
1.SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
2.Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
3.An alias only exists for the duration of the query.


***Aliases can be useful when:

1.There are more than one table involved in a query
2.Functions are used in the query
3.Column names are big or not very readable
4.Two or more columns are combined together


***Creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):
SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address
FROM Customers;



***selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). We use the "Customers" and "Orders" tables, and give them the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively (Here we use aliases to make the SQL shorter):

SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName="Around the Horn" AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;

***When displaying the Customers table, make an ALIAS of the PostalCode column, the column should be called Pno instead.

SELECT CustomerName,
Address,
PostalCode as Pno
FROM Customers;

***When displaying the Customers table, refer to the table as Consumers instead of Customers.

SELECT *
FROM Customers as Consumers;
